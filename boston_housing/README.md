Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

## Getting Started
In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:
- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.
- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.
- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.
- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.

Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.


```python
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cross_validation import ShuffleSplit

# Import supplementary visualizations code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# Load the Boston housing dataset
data = pd.read_csv('housing.csv')
prices = data['MEDV']
features = data.drop('MEDV', axis = 1)
    
# Success
print "Boston housing dataset has {} data points with {} variables each.".format(*data.shape)
```

    Boston housing dataset has 489 data points with 4 variables each.


## Data Exploration
In this first section of this project, you will make a cursory investigation about the Boston housing data and provide your observations. Familiarizing yourself with the data through an explorative process is a fundamental practice to help you better understand and justify your results.

Since the main goal of this project is to construct a working model which has the capability of predicting the value of houses, we will need to separate the dataset into **features** and the **target variable**. The **features**, `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, and `'PTRATIO'`, give us quantitative information about each data point. The **target variable**, `'MEDV'`, will be the variable we seek to predict. These are stored in `features` and `prices`, respectively.

### Implementation: Calculate Statistics
For your very first coding implementation, you will calculate descriptive statistics about the Boston housing prices. Since `numpy` has already been imported for you, use this library to perform the necessary calculations. These statistics will be extremely important later on to analyze various prediction results from the constructed model.

In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation of `'MEDV'`, which is stored in `prices`.
  - Store each calculation in their respective variable.


```python
# Minimum price of the data
minimum_price = np.amin(prices)

# Maximum price of the data
maximum_price = np.amax(prices)

# Mean price of the data
mean_price = np.mean(prices)

# Median price of the data
median_price = np.median(prices)

# Standard deviation of prices of the data
std_price = np.std(prices)

# Show the calculated statistics
#print "Statistics for Boston housing dataset:\n"
print "Minimum price: ${:,.2f}".format(minimum_price)
print "Maximum price: ${:,.2f}".format(maximum_price)
print "Mean price: ${:,.2f}".format(mean_price)
print "Median price ${:,.2f}".format(median_price)
print "Standard deviation of prices: ${:,.2f}".format(std_price)
```

    Minimum price: $105,000.00
    Maximum price: $1,024,800.00
    Mean price: $454,342.94
    Median price $438,900.00
    Standard deviation of prices: $165,171.13


### Question 1 - Feature Observation
As a reminder, we are using three features from the Boston housing dataset: `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, and `'PTRATIO'`. For each data point (neighborhood):
- `'RM'` is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.
- `'LSTAT'` is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working poor).
- `'PTRATIO'` is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.

_Using your intuition, for each of the three features above, do you think that an increase in the value of that feature would lead to an **increase** in the value of `'MEDV'` or a **decrease** in the value of `'MEDV'`? Justify your answer for each._  
**Hint:** Would you expect a home that has an `'RM'` value of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an `'RM'` value of 7?

**Answer: **

Assuming that `'MEDV'` indicates the median price paid for home for a particular data point:
- For `'RM'`, I would expect a higher value to increase the value of `'MEDV'`, since a greater amount of rooms would typically suggest a larger, more expensive home, likely built on a larger property. This might, however, not be the case if apartment buildings or multi-tenant housing are included in the dataset, rather than individual apartment units.
- For `'LSTAT'`, an increase in this value should lead to a decrease in `'MEDV'`, since a population of 'lower class' homeowners would be less likely to afford more expensive homes. Additionally, a higher level of low-income households can (fairly or not) negatively impact the desirability to invest in such a neighborhood, potentially forming an unvirtuous cycle of sorts.
- For `'PTRATIO'`, I would suspect that an increase in this value would lead to a decrease in the value of `'MEDV'`. Private schools would generally hire more teachers per students, and a similar trend might apply to public schools servicing a more affluent neighborhood

## Developing a Model
In this second section of the project, you will develop the tools and techniques necessary for a model to make a prediction. Being able to make accurate evaluations of each model's performance through the use of these tools and techniques helps to greatly reinforce the confidence in your predictions.

### Implementation: Define a Performance Metric
It is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement. For this project, you will be calculating the [*coefficient of determination*](http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=coefficient_of_determination), R<sup>2</sup>, to quantify your model's performance. The coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in regression analysis, as it often describes how "good" that model is at making predictions. 

The values for R<sup>2</sup> range from 0 to 1, which captures the percentage of squared correlation between the predicted and actual values of the **target variable**. A model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0 is no better than a model that always predicts the *mean* of the target variable, whereas a model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._

For the `performance_metric` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use `r2_score` from `sklearn.metrics` to perform a performance calculation between `y_true` and `y_predict`.
- Assign the performance score to the `score` variable.


```python
# Import 'r2_score'
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

def performance_metric(y_true, y_predict):
    """ Calculates and returns the performance score between 
        true and predicted values based on the metric chosen. """
    
    # Calculate the performance score between 'y_true' and 'y_predict'
    score = r2_score(y_true, y_predict)
    
    # Return the score
    return score
```

### Question 2 - Goodness of Fit
Assume that a dataset contains five data points and a model made the following predictions for the target variable:

| True Value | Prediction |
| :-------------: | :--------: |
| 3.0 | 2.5 |
| -0.5 | 0.0 |
| 2.0 | 2.1 |
| 7.0 | 7.8 |
| 4.2 | 5.3 |
*Would you consider this model to have successfully captured the variation of the target variable? Why or why not?* 

Run the code cell below to use the `performance_metric` function and calculate this model's coefficient of determination.


```python
# Calculate the performance of this model
score = performance_metric([3, -0.5, 2, 7, 4.2], [2.5, 0.0, 2.1, 7.8, 5.3])
print "Model has a coefficient of determination, R^2, of {:.3f}.".format(score)
```

    Model has a coefficient of determination, R^2, of 0.923.


**Answer:**

The model seems to quite successfully capture the variation of the target variable, since a coefficient of determination approaching 1 indicates a very high correlation between predicted and actual values of the target variable.

### Implementation: Shuffle and Split Data
Your next implementation requires that you take the Boston housing dataset and split the data into training and testing subsets. Typically, the data is also shuffled into a random order when creating the training and testing subsets to remove any bias in the ordering of the dataset.

For the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use `train_test_split` from `sklearn.cross_validation` to shuffle and split the `features` and `prices` data into training and testing sets.
  - Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing.
  - Set the `random_state` for `train_test_split` to a value of your choice. This ensures results are consistent.
- Assign the train and testing splits to `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`.


```python
# Import 'train_test_split'
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

# Shuffle and split the data into training and testing subsets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, prices, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Success
print "Training and testing split was successful."
```

    Training and testing split was successful.


### Question 3 - Training and Testing
*What is the benefit to splitting a dataset into some ratio of training and testing subsets for a learning algorithm?*  
**Hint:** What could go wrong with not having a way to test your model?

**Answer: **

Testing a model trained on a dataset is done in order to estimate how well the model has been trained and to estimate model properties, especially the degree of confidence one may have in the predictions the model can make on new data points (e.g. goodness of fit or some other measurement). For evaluating these properties, it is important to test on a data set which is separate from the training set, so as not to be biased by the latter.

----

## Analyzing Model Performance
In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing performances on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `'max_depth'` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects performance. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone.

### Learning Curves
The following code cell produces four graphs for a decision tree model with different maximum depths. Each graph visualizes the learning curves of the model for both training and testing as the size of the training set is increased. Note that the shaded region of a learning curve denotes the uncertainty of that curve (measured as the standard deviation). The model is scored on both the training and testing sets using R<sup>2</sup>, the coefficient of determination.  

Run the code cell below and use these graphs to answer the following question.


```python
# Produce learning curves for varying training set sizes and maximum depths
vs.ModelLearning(features, prices)
```


![png](output_20_0.png)


### Question 4 - Learning the Data
*Choose one of the graphs above and state the maximum depth for the model. What happens to the score of the training curve as more training points are added? What about the testing curve? Would having more training points benefit the model?*  
**Hint:** Are the learning curves converging to particular scores?

**Answer: **

For the model with a maximum depth of 6 (max_depth = 6), we see the training score - very high to start with - steadily decrease by a small degree as the number of training points increases. Although the certainty of the training score seems to be quite high from the outset (based on the narrow shaded area corresponding to the standard deviation), with reference to the models with lower maximum depths, I am making the assumption that this certainty becomes even higher with more training points. This suggests an over-fitting of the model particularly when trained on smaller sets of traning points, although the gradual decrease does suggest degree of generalisation.

For the same model, we see the testing score increase rapidly for the first 50-150 number of training points ranges, after which the score seems to reach a plateau. Likewise, although we see a slight increase in certainty for the ranges under 150 training points, there seems to be a negligible increase in certainty with the inclusion of more trainig points.

### Complexity Curves
The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves â€” one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  

Run the code cell below and use this graph to answer the following two questions.


```python
vs.ModelComplexity(X_train, y_train)
```


![png](output_24_0.png)


### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff
*When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?*  
**Hint:** How do you know when a model is suffering from high bias or high variance?

**Answer: **

When trained with a maximum depth of 1, the model tends towards a high degree of bias. The low scores for both training and validation at this level indicate that the model cannot account for the variance in the data.

When trained with a maximum depth of 10, however, the model becomes much better at accounting for the variance within the training set itself, but cannot generalise this variance to new data. This is indicated by the high training score but ever-decreasing validation score. Thus, a model trained at this depth suffers from high variance.

### Question 6 - Best-Guess Optimal Model
*Which maximum depth do you think results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data? What intuition lead you to this answer?*

**Answer: **

I would say that the maximum depth of either 3 or 4 would be appropriate, based on the above. Between these two depths, we see what is likely the best generalisation of the model to new data (indicated by the relative closeness of validation score to training score) on the one hand, and on the other the point at which the validation score peaks before descending again.

If pushed to choose between the above two, I would opt for a maximum depth of 4; this is supported by the difference in validation scores between maximum depths of 4 and 5 being less than that of 3 and 4, suggesting the generalisation of the model as persisting well enough beyond the latter ranges.

-----

## Evaluating Model Performance
In this final section of the project, you will construct a model and make a prediction on the client's feature set using an optimized model from `fit_model`.

### Question 7 - Grid Search
*What is the grid search technique and how it can be applied to optimize a learning algorithm?*

**Answer: **

Grid search is a technique by which you compare a set of models differing by their parameter values, in order to evaluate the appropriateness of the parameter values in relation to the performance or accuracy of the model. This technique involves the definition of the model parameters in relation to evaluation metrics as a grid; a parameter value that seems to have the most positive affect on the evaluation metric can then be identified.`

### Question 8 - Cross-Validation
*What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique? What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?*  
**Hint:** Much like the reasoning behind having a testing set, what could go wrong with using grid search without a cross-validated set?

**Answer: **

K-fold validation is a validation technique which involves splitting our data into k folds, that is to say `â€™kâ€™` equally large chunks of the entire dataset, where `â€™kâ€™` represents some discrete value. We can then iterate through the folds one-by-one, using each respective chunk as a test set and the remaining data for training. This results in k-trained and â€“evaluated models, rather than the more basic train-test split used above. Averaging the test scores across these models gives us a single, likely more reliable validation score.

K-fold validation is useful when used in combination with grid search since we can run each permutation of grid search with a different partition from the data; this should indicate the most accurate learning results in relation to the respective evaluation metrics.

### Implementation: Fitting a Model
Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.

In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.

Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.
For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.
  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.
- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.
- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.
  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.
  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.
- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.
  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. 
  - Assign the `GridSearchCV` object to the `'grid'` variable.


```python
# Import 'make_scorer', 'DecisionTreeRegressor', and 'GridSearchCV'
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer

def fit_model(X, y):
    """ Performs grid search over the 'max_depth' parameter for a 
        decision tree regressor trained on the input data [X, y]. """
    
    # Create cross-validation sets from the training data
    cv_sets = ShuffleSplit(X.shape[0], n_iter = 10, test_size = 0.20, random_state = 0)

    # Create a decision tree regressor object
    regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=0)

    # Create a dictionary for the parameter 'max_depth' with a range from 1 to 10
    params = {'max_depth': range(1, 11)}

    # Transform 'performance_metric' into a scoring function using 'make_scorer' 
    scoring_fnc = make_scorer(performance_metric)

    # Create the grid search object
    grid = GridSearchCV(regressor, params, scoring_fnc, cv=cv_sets)

    # Fit the grid search object to the data to compute the optimal model
    grid = grid.fit(X, y)

    # Return the optimal model after fitting the data
    return grid.best_estimator_
```

### Making Predictions
Once a model has been trained on a given set of data, it can now be used to make predictions on new sets of input data. In the case of a *decision tree regressor*, the model has learned *what the best questions to ask about the input data are*, and can respond with a prediction for the **target variable**. You can use these predictions to gain information about data where the value of the target variable is unknown â€” such as data the model was not trained on.

### Question 9 - Optimal Model
_What maximum depth does the optimal model have? How does this result compare to your guess in **Question 6**?_  

Run the code block below to fit the decision tree regressor to the training data and produce an optimal model.


```python
# Fit the training data to the model using grid search
reg = fit_model(X_train, y_train)

# Produce the value for 'max_depth'
print "Parameter 'max_depth' is {} for the optimal model.".format(reg.get_params()['max_depth'])
```

    Parameter 'max_depth' is 4 for the optimal model.


**Answer: **

The maximum depth of the model identified as optimal is 4, which is very much in line with the expectations established from question 6.

### Question 10 - Predicting Selling Prices
Imagine that you were a real estate agent in the Boston area looking to use this model to help price homes owned by your clients that they wish to sell. You have collected the following information from three of your clients:

| Feature | Client 1 | Client 2 | Client 3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Total number of rooms in home | 5 rooms | 4 rooms | 8 rooms |
| Neighborhood poverty level (as %) | 17% | 32% | 3% |
| Student-teacher ratio of nearby schools | 15-to-1 | 22-to-1 | 12-to-1 |
*What price would you recommend each client sell his/her home at? Do these prices seem reasonable given the values for the respective features?*  
**Hint:** Use the statistics you calculated in the **Data Exploration** section to help justify your response.  

Run the code block below to have your optimized model make predictions for each client's home.


```python
# Produce a matrix for client data
client_data = [[5, 17, 15], # Client 1
               [4, 32, 22], # Client 2
               [8, 3, 12]]  # Client 3

# Show predictions
for i, price in enumerate(reg.predict(client_data)):
    print "Predicted selling price for Client {}'s home: ${:,.2f}".format(i+1, price)
```

    Predicted selling price for Client 1's home: $391,183.33
    Predicted selling price for Client 2's home: $189,123.53
    Predicted selling price for Client 3's home: $942,666.67


**Answer: **

Based on our model, we can make the following price recommendation to each client:

- Client 1: \$391,183.33
- Client 2: \$189,123.53
- Client 3: \$942,666.67

From our descriptive statistics, we know the mean price stands at \$454,342.94, with our median price at \$438,900.00. The standard deviation is \$165,171.13 USD, indicating a range of normal price values for this dataset falling within a minimum and maximum price of \$105,000.00 and \$1,024,800.00, respectively.

With that in mind, we can interrogate whether these values are reasonable.

- For Client 1, the suggested price - while falling under the mean - could be explained by a relatively high neighborhood poverty level (the mean for the dataset being 12.94%). Similarly, it's features in relation to the sample mean (6.24 and 18.52) for number of rooms and student-to-teacher ratio of nearby schools, respectively, help qualify the price as below mean but within the standard deviation from the mean.

- Client 2, on the other hand, scores badly on all features, the values for these approaching the extreme cases (for instance, the student-teacher ratio of nearby schools for this house is the minimum for this value out of the entire set). Therefore, the predicted cost still seems to be reasonable.

- Lastly, the house for Client 3 scores on the opposite extremes of those of Client 2. Without exloring the underlying structure of our sample data structure, however, the seemingly disproportionate increase in predicted price makes it more difficult to argue that this prediction is entirely reasonable. However, some hints in favour of this include the disproportionate difference between the mean and minimun price, and mean and maximum price, respectively, and the median falling below our mean; these two points together indicate a more dispersed range of values for more expensive houses compared to a more condensed range of lower-prices houses, rather than a normal distribution of prices.


### Disclaimer: the following was added following review of project and feedback from reviewer


```python
# Plot the features against the dataset for a better view
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

clients = np.transpose(client_data)
pred = reg.predict(client_data)
for i, feat in enumerate(['RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO']):
    plt.scatter(features[feat], prices, alpha=0.25, c=prices)
    plt.scatter(clients[i], pred, color='black', marker='x', linewidth=2)

### Sensitivity
An optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable â€” i.e., the model is underfitted. Run the code cell below to run the `fit_model` function ten times with different training and testing sets to see how the prediction for a specific client changes with the data it's trained on.


```python
vs.PredictTrials(features, prices, fit_model, client_data)
```

    Trial 1: $391,183.33
    Trial 2: $424,935.00
    Trial 3: $415,800.00
    Trial 4: $420,622.22
    Trial 5: $418,377.27
    Trial 6: $411,931.58
    Trial 7: $399,663.16
    Trial 8: $407,232.00
    Trial 9: $351,577.61
    Trial 10: $413,700.00
    
    Range in prices: $73,357.39


### Question 11 - Applicability
*In a few sentences, discuss whether the constructed model should or should not be used in a real-world setting.*  
**Hint:** Some questions to answering:
- *How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978?*
- *Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home?*
- *Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?*
- *Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?*

**Answer: **

I would not consider the model to be appropriate for production application.

It is highly unlikely that data collected almost 40 years ago would still apply, even when correcting for inflation. As suggested above, the model cannot take account of the reciprocal impact the demand and desirability - or lack thereof - could have on a neighbrhood, and even less of external influences such as gentrification, without the addition of temporal data.

Furthermore, the range in predicted prices discovered when running `PredictTrials` on our `fit_model` - a range equating almost 8% of the range between minimum and maximum prices of our entire dataset - calls into question the robustness of our model.

Additionally, even though we might find that our feature selection adequately captures the underlying characterisation of the population at large - even if only by proxy - this still would stand to be questioned by exploring the other available features for our sample.
